# Takehometest1
This project is to show different places on the map

# Prerequisite
Please register in [mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) and get the api token. Then, referring to `.env.example`, create `.env` file inside the root folder and put the token inside.

## Get Started
refer to package.json.
run
```npm run start```
to start the program

## Details
- this project is based on [nx](https://nx.dev/)
- use [MUI](https://mui.com/) as the layout library
- MUI caters for the UI responsiveness
- only load first 10 elements for each table to speed up the UI rendering
- trimmed the coordinates of some pages for faster UI rendering
- test is included for the data loading service


## Improvements
- may extract all the api url into 1 separate file if needed in the future
- can have the CICD to automatically build and deploy to the destination once merged into the master branch
- this hasn't implemented the error handling. Can show error message when failed to load the data or other failures
